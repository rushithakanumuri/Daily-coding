Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.

For example, the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".





def longest_palindrome(s):
    if not s:
        return ''

    longest = s[0]
    A = [[None for _ in range(len(s))] for _ in range(len(s))]

    # Set all substrings of length 1 to be true
    for i in range(len(s)):
        A[i][i] = True

    # Try all substrings of length 2
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        A[i][i + 1] = s[i] == s[i + 1]

    i, k = 0, 3
    while k <= len(s):
        while i < (len(s) - k + 1) :
            j = i + k - 1
            A[i][j] = A[i + 1][j - 1] and s[i] == s[j]
            # Update longest if necessary
            if A[i][j] and len(s[i:j + 1]) > len(longest):
                longest = s[i:j + 1]
            i += 1
        k += 1
        i = 0
    return longest
