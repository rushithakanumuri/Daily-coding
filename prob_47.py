Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.







def buy_and_sell(arr):
    max_profit = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(i, len(arr)):
            buy_price, sell_price = arr[i], arr[j]
            max_profit = max(max_profit, sell_price - buy_price)
    return max_profit
