Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.

For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.

Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.

Do this in O(N) time.



def max_subarray_sum(arr):
     max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
     for x in arr:
         max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
         max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
     return max_so_far
